## Summary
This report summarises the results of an analysis of the costs and benefits of the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart programme. Under the programme, subsidies are provided towards the costs of retrofitting insulation and/or installing clean heating for pre-2000 houses.

The benefits that are included in this report are analysed in more detail in three separate papers produced as part of this study that assess the impacts on energy use, health outcomes and producer surpluses, with additional data on employment.

The costs of the programme are also assessed in this report and include the costs of the additional insulation and clean heating plus the administrative costs falling on the government. Administrative costs for companies are assessed as part of the report on impacts on industry.

**Key Findings:**
*   Benefit-Cost Ratio ~4:1.
*   99% of benefits are health-related (reduced respiratory illness).
