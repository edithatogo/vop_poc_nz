## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate action in response to unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors deemed inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** – A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.
2. **Warning** – A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the involved parties, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
3. **Temporary Ban** – A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
