# Project To-Do List

This document lists the outstanding tasks for the 'Value of Perspective' research project.

## High Priority

- [ ] **Execute Systematic Literature Review:** The protocol has been developed, but the search needs to be executed by an external agent.
- [ ] **Data Extraction:** The data from the selected studies needs to be extracted by an external agent.
- [ ] **Model Parameterization:** The advanced economic model needs to be parameterized with the real-world data.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Develop User Interface for Policy Tool:** The back-end model needs to be connected to a user-friendly front-end.
- [ ] **Write User Guides and Training Materials:** Comprehensive documentation needs to be developed for the policy tool.

## Low Priority

- [ ] **Explore Alternative Predictive Models:** The current plan is to use a logistic regression model, but other machine learning models could be explored.
- [ ] **Conduct Qualitative Interviews with Policymakers:** To supplement the quantitative findings, it would be valuable to conduct qualitative interviews with policymakers about how they would use the outputs of this analysis.
