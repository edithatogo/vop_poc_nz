# C14 independent review

## Outcome

No Critical, High, or Medium implementation defect remains after three
independent review streams and remediation. The repository-owned track is
complete; merge, governance-baseline approval, issue closure, and release remain
human or external gates.

## Exact-head evidence

- VOP `efcfec2`: CI `29696625322`, supply-chain `29696625319`, documentation
  `29696625289`, and expensive Quality Frontier `29696627403` passed. Critical
  mutation killed 70/71 mutants (98.592%).
- VOIAGE `10f356f`: PR CI `29696804563` and expensive CI `29696807202` passed;
  total coverage was 90.08%, critical mutation killed 40/40 mutants, and all
  CodeQL, binding, dependency, benchmark, supply-chain, and action-audit runs
  passed.
- Local VOP strict governance harness passed all eight stages. VOIAGE's focused
  bundle suite passed 93 tests and reached 93% branch coverage.

## Retained human gate

The committed governance baseline is intentionally
`unverified_initial_snapshot`. The auditor correctly exits 4 rather than calling
that state clean. After merge, an authorized reviewer must capture a
`verified_last_applied` baseline with source revision, provide read-only Project
v2 access, and retain a clean scheduled or dispatched audit artifact. The
fail-closed behavior must not be weakened.
